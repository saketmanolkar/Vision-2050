# Vision-2050

The core aim of this project is to deploy AI and ML techniques to chart India's journey towards 2050, focusing on 8 critical development metrics such as GDP, GDP growth, GDP per capita, employment-to-population ratio, unemployment rate, literacy rate, population growth rate, and access to electricity. The project will involve not just predicting future values but also mapping historical trends for each development metric against global benchmarks to provide a broader contextual backdrop for India's growth narrative.
